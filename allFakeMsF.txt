The mother then searched for her daughter in a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s home. Rojano-Nieto is said to have put his hand over the girl\xe2\x80\x99s mouth to keep her from crying for her mother. He then made the toddler touch his penis.\nRojano-Nieto then unlocked the garage door and let her into the home where her mother found her. Moments later, her mother found out what happened when her daughter complained of pain., Kelly agreed that under most circumstances the [25-year mandatory] sentence would be appropriate.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, in looking at the facts of Mr. Rojano\xe2\x80\x99s case, the manner in which this offense was committed is not typical of a predatory, violent brutal sodomy of a child case,\xe2\x80\x9d Kelly said. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Roiano did not seek out or stalk (the victim). He was playing video games and she wandered into the garage. He inexplicably became sexually aroused but did not appear to consciously intend to harm (the victim) when he sexually assaulted her.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe defendant \xe2\x80\x9calmost immediately\xe2\x80\x9d stopped and \xe2\x80\x9crealized the wrongfulness of his act,\xe2\x80\x9d Kelly said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough serious and despicable, this does not compare to a situation where a pedophilic child predator preys on an innocent child,\xe2\x80\x9d Kelly said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no violence or callous disregard for (the victim\xe2\x80\x99s) well-being.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe judge also noted the defendant \xe2\x80\x9chas shown extreme remorse for his actions and has been willing to accept the consequences,\xe2\x80\x9d Kelly said. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Rojano was born into and raised in a dysfunctional familiar environment.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPointing to a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s report, the judge said that while growing up the defendant suffered \xe2\x80\x9ca great deal of family disruption and abuse, making him an insecure, socially withdrawn, timid, and extremely immature young man with limited self-esteem.\xe2\x80\x9d, [Judge Kelly] also backed the claim from child rapist Kevin Rojano that the young girl initiated the act of sodomy. Rojano said in his own defense that \xe2\x80\x9cshe asked me to do it.\xe2\x80\x9c, Sodomy of a 3 year old child is a horrific crime, and imposition of harsh punishment will ordinarily not give rise to constitutional concerns.\nHowever, in looking at the facts of Mr. Rojano\xe2\x80\x99s case, the manner in which this offense was committed is not typical of a predatory, violent brutal sodomy of a child case:\nMr. Rojano did not seek out or stalk his sister. He was playing video games and she wandered into the garage. He inexplicably became sexually aroused but did not appear to consciously intend to harm [her] when he sexually assaulted her; as noted by defense, in an instant, he reacted to a sexual urge and stopped almost immediately after he put his penis in [her] anus.\nWithin seconds of commencing his offense, he realized the wrongfulness of his act and stopped without ejaculating.\nAlthough serious and despicable, this does not compare to a situation where a pedophilic child predator preys on an innocent child. There was no violence or callous disregard for [the victim\xe2\x80\x99s] well-being.\nPer Dr. Apodaca: Mr. Rojano is not a sexual predator and is not a pedophile, nor a sexual deviant. As the defense has noted, he is a confused young man who acted inappropriately in an instant with immensely damaging ramifications for the victim, his family, and himself.\nAs a result, a mandatory term of 25 years to Life in state prison for Mr. Rojano\xe2\x80\x99s offense is grossly disproportionate to his individual culpability, and thus would amount to cruel and unusual punishment in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s eyes., We do not agree with the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the significance of Rojano\xe2\x80\x99s actions. Although the trial court minimized the serious nature of Rojano\xe2\x80\x99s molestation of [the victim] by characterizing it as happening \xe2\x80\x9cin an instant\xe2\x80\x9d and stopping \xe2\x80\x9cwithin seconds\xe2\x80\x9d when Rojano \xe2\x80\x9crealized the wrongfulness of his act,\xe2\x80\x9d the trial court ignored important undisputed evidence about the entire scope of Rojano\xe2\x80\x99s actions. Crucially, Rojano was charged with and convicted of two separate criminal acts against [the victim], namely (1) sodomizing her, which was the factual basis for count 1; and (2) making her touch his penis and masturbate him, which was the factual basis for count 2. During the interview with the social worker, [the victim] stated that Rojano made her touch his penis after he sodomized her. Therefore, it is simply not accurate to characterize the evidence as showing that Rojano acted momentarily and impulsively, and then immediately stopped the molestation when he recognized that it was wrong. Instead of ceasing the molestation after sodomizing [the victim], Rojano continued to molest [the victim] by committing a second sexually predatory criminal act. Further, the evidence shows that rather than being based on a momentary impulse that occurred in an \xe2\x80\x9cinstant,\xe2\x80\x9d Rojano\xe2\x80\x99s molestation of [the victim] was something upon which he had time to reflect before acting. Specifically, Rojano locked the garage door and spoke with [the victim] about buying [her] Cheetos before commencing his wrongful acts.\nFor the reasons we have set forth \xe2\x80\xa6 we conclude that Rojano committed a grave and serious offense when he sodomized [the victim]. Therefore, a sentence of 25 years to life is not grossly disproportionate to the crime and does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.', 'Link': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sentenced-reduced-3-year-old-asked/', 'image_info': {u'color': {u'accentColor': u'282C22', u'dominantColorForeground': u'Black', u'dominantColorBackground': u'Brown', u'dominantColors': [u'Brown', u'Black'], u'isBwImg': False}, u'requestId': u'98460d87-6d67-4717-b800-73cd95a70ee3', u'description': {u'captions': [{u'text': u'a person wearing a suit and tie', u'confidence': 0.9560665276478938}], u'tags': [u'person', u'man', u'indoor', u'clothing', u'front', u'suit', u'standing', u'table', u'woman', u'holding', u'cake', u'sitting', u'older', u'black', u'people', u'wearing', u'smiling', u'old', u'birthday', u'large', u'yellow', u'phone', u'train', u'group', u'plate', u'display', u'kitchen']}, u'categories': [{u'score': 0.85546875, u'name': u'people_', u'detail': {u'celebrities': []}}], u'metadata': {u'width': 542, u'height': 305, u'format': u'Jpeg'}}, 'id': 91}

That\xe2\x80\x99s a criticism that I take to heart.\xa0Most people would agree I\xe2\x80\x99ve toned thing down considerably., Early in the morning of April 20th we poured concrete on the train tracks that lead out of the Port of Olympia to block any trains from using the tracks. We took precautions to notify BNSF (the train company) \xe2\x80\x93 we called them and we used wires to send a signal that the tracks were blocked.

In any case it was removed well before this latest tragedy.\nOur reading of the communique is that individual(s) stopped a train (not derailing it). They took precautions to protect human life and reach their goal, by both signalling the company and sending a message on the tracks. This seemed synchronous with the spirit and intention of their goal \xe2\x80\x93 stop natural gas fracking., I do understand that many are beginning to look back at things historically in the Olympia area today, likely due to the incident this morning.

The Sonoma County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office arrested a man on Sunday [15 October] for arson, in Maxwell Park in Sonoma. There\xe2\x80\x99s a story out there that he\xe2\x80\x99s the arsonist for these fires \xe2\x80\x93 that is not the case. There is no indication he is related to these fires at all.\n\xe2\x80\xa6Our arson case involves someone who\xe2\x80\x99s known to the deputies, he frequents Maxwell Park, he\xe2\x80\x99s been known to sleep there, he was walking away from\xe2\x80\xa6a small fire, they stopped him. He had a fire extinguisher and a lighter with him. They asked him if he started the fire [in Maxwell Park], he said he started the fire to warm himself up, something to that effect., Once again, a non-cooperative jurisdiction has left their community vulnerable to dangerous individuals and preventable crimes. ICE lodged a detainer against Jesus Gonzalez with Sonoma County jail officials on October 16, following his arrest on felony charges for maliciously setting fire to a property. This is especially troubling in light of the massive wildfires already devastating the region.\nOver the past year, ICE has lodged detainers against Mr. Gonzalez after four separate arrests by Sonoma County on various felony and misdemeanor charges. ICE was never notified of Mr. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99 various releases. Additionally, Mr. Gonzales has been returned to his home country of Mexico on two separate occasions. The residents of Sonoma County, and the state of California, deserve better than policies that expose them to avoidable dangers. Non-cooperation policies \xe2\x80\x93 now enshrined in California state law \xe2\x80\x93 ensure only one thing: criminals who would otherwise be deported will be released and left free to reoffend as they please., The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a press release yesterday that was inaccurate, inflammatory, and damages the relationship we have with our community\xe2\x80\xa6ICE sent a detainer requesting the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office hold Gonzalez for 48 hours past his scheduled release time. However, this detainer is not signed by a judge so the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office cannot legally honor it. Multiple Federal court cases have determined these administrative detainers are unconstitutional.\n\xe2\x80\xa6Gonzalez has been in our jail approximately 8 times for minor misdemeanor offenses. We have notified ICE about his release in several of those arrests as they took place before our recent policy change. We will continue to notify ICE if it complies with law and our policy. But as I stated earlier, they can seek a warrant and we will hold him.\nICE attacked the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office in the midst of the largest natural disaster this county has ever experienced. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated, many people have lost their homes and 23 people have died from this firestorm. ICE\xe2\x80\x99s misleading statement stirs fear in some of our community members who are already exhausted and scared., President Donald Trump was absolutely right once again.

There is a high chance that \xe2\x80\x9cSorcha Faal\xe2\x80\x9d is actually David Booth, the owner/operator of the website, or someone collaborating with him.\nThe primary audience of Sorcha Faal\xe2\x80\x99s reports and the only ones who take them seriously are usually other conspiracy theorists.\nEach report resembles a news story in its style, but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality (e.g. \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Rebel Forces Attack Gas Pipelines, Explode Trains As US Civil War Nears\xe2\x80\x9d[8]) and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service in the same article) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don\xe2\x80\x99t contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish. Cited sources range from the mainstream media and Wikipedia to Infowars and Richard Hoagland. The author also has the habit of adding unnecessary links to the websites of the various Russian institutions they mention., If you get your local news from the Democrat and Chronicle or television news stations in town, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard about the Fairport man who killed himself and his daughter.\nNamely that the man, John Beilman, was a \xe2\x80\x9ckey witness\xe2\x80\x9d in the Las Vegas mass shooting and was \xe2\x80\x9cwanted by federal agents\xe2\x80\x9d in connection to the massacre.\nIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t true, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been widely circulated online via social media courtesy of bogus news websites and their readers, most of whom are unschooled in news literacy and unable to parse fact from fiction.\nThe Beilman-Las Vegas connection appears to have originated on a website called WhatDoesItMean.com in a report dated Oct. 7 under the bizarre byline of \xe2\x80\x9cSorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFaal is a suspected pseudonym of the website\xe2\x80\x99s owner. Shoddy and fictitious sourcing, half-truths and bewildering leaps of logic are trademarks of her reporting.\nNone of this has stopped her story from being circulated by websites known to publish schlock and sensational disinformation for the purpose of profiting through clickbait. Two such sites are Neon Nettle and USSA News, which bills itself as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Tea Party\xe2\x80\x99s Front Page.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFrom there, the story has been spread like wildfire on social media by unsophisticated news illiterates whose reality is so muddied they can\xe2\x80\x99t tell truth from fiction anymore. It\xe2\x80\x99s sad and dangerous and undermining our institutions.\nIs it coincidence that Beilman committed the murder-suicide within hours of the FBI search of his home? We don\xe2\x80\x99t know for sure, but probably not. It\xe2\x80\x99s very likely that the search motivated Beilman to act.\nWhat federal agents were looking for at Beilman\xe2\x80\x99s house hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been reported because the search warrant affidavit, which was signed by a judge authorizing the search, is under seal., I want to emphasize we believe Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act. We are aware of the rumors outside of the media and also on social media that there was more than one assailant. We have no information or evidence to support that theory, or that rumor.

David Meade, the man the Fox News article cites as their source for these claims, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any formal, academic training in numerology.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, multiple news outlets are referencing the findings of a man with, according to his website, nothing more than a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree in Economics and Astrology from an unnamed institution.\nFurthermore, Meade doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide us with evidence of any biblical training he has received in order to speak authoritatively about the end times. He is discussing biblical matters of profound significance and making predictions about events of global importance without any real authority on these topics.\nTo make matters worse, the planetary alignments that Meade is using to support his claims about the end of the world have, according to an Express article, already happened four times in the past 1000 years.\nMeade is a made-up leader in a made-up field, and should not be on the front page of anything, let alone Fox News.\nAnd, when we remind people of this, maybe they will be less likely to report on it next time.\n', 'Link': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nasa-warns-nibiru-is-headed-straight-for-earth/', 'image_info': {u'color': {u'accentColor': u'C00C0B', u'dominantColorForeground': u'Black', u'dominantColorBackground': u'Black', u'dominantColors': [u'Black'], u'isBwImg': False}, u'requestId': u'672ed009-14ee-4e0f-ab67-d9fcf4d7053b', u'description': {u'captions': [{u'text': u'a star filled sky', u'confidence': 0.44064316251434144}], u'tags': [u'sitting', u'photo', u'star', u'table', u'red', u'bowl', u'food', u'water', u'plate', u'laying']}, u'categories': [{u'score': 0.00390625, u'name': u'others_'}, {u'score': 0.01953125, u'name': u'outdoor_', u'detail': {u'landmarks': []}}, {u'score': 0.33203125, u'name': u'text_sign'}], u'metadata': {u'width': 542, u'height': 305, u'format': u'Png'}}, 'id': 265}

{'Title': '\nWoman Comes Out of Grave and Walks After Being Dead for Three Years?\nTall tales of "walking dead" corpses in Indonesia appear to have been inspired by the unusual funerary practices of the Toraja people of Sulawesi.\t\t\n', 'Image': 'https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2017/07/undead_hand_fb.jpg?resize=542,305', 'Content': 'In Indonesia, in the town of Toraja, a woman leaves her grave after being dead for 3 years.\nFortunately, this event was caught on camera and it\xe2\x80\x99s the evidence of how this woman was resurrected after that much time.\nThere is no doubt that this is a frightening and surprising fact.\nThey say that in order to bring her back to life, a special rite is performed in the place of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s tomb., The story of a dead corpse has been around since time immemorial. Hundreds of years ago it was said that there was a civil war in Tana Toraja namely the Toraja West fought against the East Toraja people. In the battle the West Toraja was defeated because most of them were killed, but at the time of going home their entire corpse of the Toraja West was walking, while the East Toraja people though only a few were killed but they took the corpses of their dead brother, Then the war is considered a series. On the next offspring the Toraja people often bury their corpses by way of the corpse walking alone to the grave.\nThe phenomenon of \xe2\x80\x9cWalking bodies\xe2\x80\x9d that I myself have witnessed directly. The incident occurred around the year 1992 (I\xe2\x80\x99m new grade 3 elementary). At that time in my village there was a man named Pongbarrak whose mother died. Such as Toraja custom the corpse is not directly buried but still has to go through a customary procession of burial (signs solo \xe2\x80\x98). At that time after bathing the dead body of the mother is placed in bed in a special room before it is inserted into the coffin. On the third night the whole family gathered to talk about how the funeral procession would take place. At that time I sat on the porch of the house understand the children so like to pace. But after the meeting is over (around 10 pm), suddenly there is a noise in the house where some mothers shout. Out of curiosity I tried to look into the house and the dead man was walking out of the room, just cash me and my friends screamed hysterically and ran down the stairs. I ran and got my dad hysterically scared. After that I was taken home by father and I do not know what happened next.\xa0, In Tana Toraja, the most important social moments in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives, the focal points of social and cultural interaction are not weddings or births or even family dinners, but funerals. So these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals \xe2\x80\x94\xa0pigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo \xe2\x80\x94\xa0that are sacrificed and distributed in the name of the deceased. So this cultural complex surrounding death, the ritual enactment of the end of life, has made death the most visible and remarkable aspect of Toraja\xe2\x80\x99s landscape. Lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair, where commemorating someone who\xe2\x80\x99s died is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a transition that\xe2\x80\x99s just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead., So where we see an unquestionable reality, death as an irrefutable biological condition, Torajans see the expired corporeal form as part of a larger social genesis. So again, the physical cessation of life is not the same as death. In fact, a member of society is only truly dead when the extended family can agree upon and marshal the resources necessary to hold a funeral ceremony that is considered appropriate in terms of resources for the status of the deceased. And this ceremony has to take place in front of the eyes of the whole community with everyone\xe2\x80\x99s participation\xe2\x80\xa6.\nUntil the funeral ceremony, which can be held years after a person\xe2\x80\x99s physical death, the deceased is referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cto makala,\xe2\x80\x9d a sick person, or \xe2\x80\x9cto mama,\xe2\x80\x9d a person who is asleep, and they continue to be a member of the household. They are symbolically fed and cared for, and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions, which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life into the afterlife known as Puya.\nSo I know what some of you must be thinking right now. Is she really saying that these people live with the bodies of their dead relatives? And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying., \xe2\x80\x9cWhat started happening, as best as I can piece together, was migrants who had moved to Jakarta and other parts of Indonesia, who were often second-generation migrants, were coming back,\xe2\x80\x9d Adams says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe city folk would want a picture next to their deceased relatives, and the images started circulating on Facebook. Toraja became suddenly internationally associated with this idea of the \xe2\x80\x98walking dead\xe2\x80\x99 and zombies.\xe2\x80\x9d, Many Torajans relate that in the past, powerful ritual practitioners could make a corpse walk on its own. This practice is not done anymore, according to many Torajans, because it is a kind of magic that is not appropriate for modern Christians, and the majority of Torajans identify as Protestant Christians today. In addition, there are many stories of other kinds of revenants that the living encounter in Indonesia, so the circulation of these kinds of stories is quite common in the Indonesian media.', 'Link': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/woman-comes-out-of-grave/', 'image_info': {u'color': {u'accentColor': u'BB4A10', u'dominantColorForeground': u'Black', u'dominantColorBackground': u'White', u'dominantColors': [u'White', u'Black'], u'isBwImg': False}, u'requestId': u'1673cf69-9543-405f-a28a-895c28c13898', u'description': {u'captions': [{u'text': u'a person standing in front of a sunset', u'confidence': 0.7095683866649337}], u'tags': [u'sunset', u'outdoor', u'sun', u'flying', u'mountain', u'background', u'standing', u'front', u'clouds', u'water', u'beach', u'air', u'large', u'bird', u'kite', u'plane', u'cloudy', u'man', u'orange', u'ocean', u'holding', u'tall', u'rock', u'giraffe', u'airplane', u'blue']}, u'categories': [{u'score': 0.03125, u'name': u'others_'}, {u'score': 0.00390625, u'name': u'outdoor_', u'detail': {u'landmarks': []}}], u'metadata': {u'width': 542, u'height': 305, u'format': u'Jpeg'}}, 'id': 324}

Though the Pacific Ocean is a vast stretch of water, Fukushima\xe2\x80\x99s radiation is reaching the coast of the United States, Canada, and Mexico, contaminating the fish we eat and the water we swim in., Mark Whitby, chairman and design director of the engineering and consultancy firm WME Consultants, explained that today about 400 tons of water go into each reactor to cool it. Part of the highly radioactive water is recycled to re-cool the reactors, and the rest goes into big tanks, which are stacking up at a fast rate. As reported by TRT, Japan is running out of storage space. There are currently about a 1,000 storage tanks holding 920,000 tons of contaminated water.\nAs if the marine life isn\xe2\x80\x99t struggling enough already by the vast amounts of plastic in the oceans, the Japanese are now talking about dumping these tanks with nuclear wastewater directly into the sea because they cannot keep building and storing these reservoirs, Whitby told TRT., They\xe2\x80\x99re now getting to the point where they are beginning to talk about wanting to just drop the tanks into the ocean, because they just can\xe2\x80\x99t keep building these tanks to keep the place cool., The Tokyo Electric Power Company is pumping water nonstop through the three reactors to cool melted fuel that remains too hot and radioactive to remove. About 400 tons of water pass through the reactors every day, including groundwater that seeps in. The water picks up radiation in the reactors and then is diverted into a decontamination facility.\nBut the decontamination filters cannot remove all the radioactive material. So for now, all this water is being stored in 1,000 gray, blue and white tanks on the grounds. The tanks already hold 962,000 tons of contaminated water, and Tokyo Electric is installing more tanks. It is also trying to slow the flow of groundwater through the reactors by building an underground ice wall.\nWithin a few years, though, and no one is sure exactly when, the plant may run out of room to store the contaminated water. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot continue to build tanks forever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shigenori Hata, an official at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.\nThe authorities are debating whether it might be acceptable, given the relatively low radioactive levels in the water, to dilute the contaminated water and then dump it into the ocean. But local fishermen are vehemently opposed. Many people still do not trust Tokyo Electric because of its bungled response to the disaster, the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl., \xe2\x80\x9cControlled discharge is a regular practice at all nuclear facilities in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Juan Carlos Lentijo, director of the IAEA Division of Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Waste Technology, told a news conference in Tokyo as the team wrapped up its inspection of the plant.', 'Link': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/japan-dump-fukushima-nuclear-waste/', 'image_info': {u'color': {u'accentColor': u'906914', u'dominantColorForeground': u'Grey', u'dominantColorBackground': u'Grey', u'dominantColors': [u'Grey'], u'isBwImg': False}, u'requestId': u'15e5ee4a-e35e-4e6f-b12c-0cc0179ed9fd', u'description': {u'captions': [{u'text': u'a sign on the side of a fence', u'confidence': 0.8074820411766714}], u'tags': [u'fence', u'outdoor', u'sitting', u'snow', u'red', u'standing', u'track', u'riding', u'street', u'man', u'group', u'traffic', u'sign', u'white', u'parked', u'train', u'people', u'playing', u'bus']}, u'categories': [{u'score': 0.37890625, u'name': u'abstract_texture'}], u'metadata': {u'width': 542, u'height': 305, u'format': u'Jpeg'}}, 'id': 339}

They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned.\xe2\x80\x9d Do you believe that that statement is Islamophobic?\nVought: Absolutely not, Senator. I\xe2\x80\x99m a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many Muslims there are in America. Maybe a couple million. Are you suggesting that all those people stand condemned? What about Jews? Do they stand condemned too?\nVought: Senator, I\xe2\x80\x99m a Christian\xa0\xe2\x80\x94\nSanders (shouting): I understand you are a Christian, but this country are made of people who are not just \xe2\x80\x94\xa0I understand that Christianity is the majority religion, but there are other people of different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?\nVought: Thank you for probing on that question. As a Christian, I believe that all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs. I believe that as a Christian that\xe2\x80\x99s how I should treat all individuals.\nSanders: You think your statement that you put into that publication, they do not know God because they rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned, do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s respectful of other religions?\nVought: Senator, I wrote a post based on being a Christian and attending a Christian school that has a statement of faith that speaks clearly in regard to the centrality of Jesus Christ in salvation.\nSanders: I would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who this country is supposed to be about. I will vote no., It\xe2\x80\x99s another to try to exclude people from office based on their theological convictions. Sanders used the term \xe2\x80\x9cIslamophobia\xe2\x80\x9d to suggest that Vought fears Muslims for who they are. But in his writing, Vought was contesting something different: He disagrees with what Muslims believe, and does not think their faith is satisfactory for salvation. Right or wrong, this is a conviction held by millions of Americans\xe2\x80\x94and many Muslims might say the same thing about Christianity.\nThis is the danger of relying on religion as a threshold test for public service, the kind of test America\xe2\x80\x99s founders were guarding against when they drafted Article VI., Religious freedom is such a fundamental liberty that the framers of our Constitution enshrined it in the First Amendment.

I can\xe2\x80\x99t draw, not even poorly enough to be good, and so I write these pieces. The trouble is, unlike a political cartoon, which broadcasts its satirical roots by its appearance, these articles can easily be mistaken for news. The layout I chose for the web page is a broadsheet, or in other words it was intended as a template for a news site. I did that to try to frame the absurd as hilariously near to the truth, but it strikes me now that this crossed over into masquerade. The same is true of my many Facebook posts, which look exactly like those made by reputable news sources, about actual events. \nMoving forward, what I intend to do about this ambiguity, is remove it. From here onward all posts that are satirical, or in anyway reference fictional events, will make this clear. There will be disclaimers  both on the blog itself, and in Facebook posts and tweets about it. I know Facebook is working on ways to weed out, or signify fake news, and I think this is very much needed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be following developments to see if there will be a way to self-identify posts as satirical, such as a large banner shouting that in capital letters with multiple exclamation marks.

Without comment on the subject of the protests, however, there is still reason to believe that the high profile murders of two young adults in the area being swept under the rug by city officials, has given parents and prospective students a cautionary eye when it comes to SIUC.

Yes we received hostages back, but at the same time Iran got all this money and who knows what they are going to do with it.\nThe White House tried to frame the money sent as anything but a ransom. They instead claimed it was the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst installment of the $1.7 billion in the United States seized in 1979 after an arms deal with the Shah of Iran was halted following the Islamic revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut everyone can assume that it was really a ransom. No matter which way you frame it, people are going to suspect it was a ransom payment., Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said the payment to Iran was part of the resolution of a longstanding financial dispute between the two nations, and was delivered in cash on pallets because the two nations do not have a banking relationship.\nMr. Earnest also denounced the assertions from some Republicans that the $400 million in foreign currency delivered to Iran was a ransom for four Americans released at the time. He compared the statements from Republicans to those of conservatives in Iran who oppose the nuclear agreement.\nThe existence of the payment was disclosed in January, and Mr. Earnest dismissed a Wall Street Journal report on Wednesday about the details of the cash payment as a \xe2\x80\x9csix-month-old news story\xe2\x80\x9d that is being pushed by opponents of the president\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear deal with Iran.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of just how badly opponents of the Iran deal are struggling to justify their opposition to a successful deal,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Earnest said., However, the $400 million dollar transfer was actually an openly announced one, paid in settlement of a nearly 40-year dispute between Iran and the United States \xe2\x80\x94 a settlement that likely saved the United States several billion dollars.\nBack in late 1979, after Iranian revolutionaries took 52 Americans hostage at the US Embassy in Tehran, the United States severed diplomatic relations with Iran and froze Iranian assets in America. Among those frozen assets was a $400 million delivery of fighter jets from the U.S. that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s previous government had already paid for.\nAlthough the American hostages were finally released a year later, issues such as the frozen Iranian assets (including that $400 million) were not settled at that time. Instead, an international court based in the Hague, the Iran\xe2\x80\x93United States Claims Tribunal was established to deal with such legal claims. The tribunal process dragged on for years and years without a ruling on the $400 million being issued, and finally, when arbitration process was apparently about to wind up (quite possibly not in American\xe2\x80\x99s favor), the U.S. agreed to pay Iran back the $400 million principal along with $1.3 billion in interest. If the issue had gone to the tribunal for a decision, as was expected, the U.S. could have been on the hook for the full $10 billion in compensation Iran was seeking., The President was quite forward-leaning, in advance of the nuclear deal even being completed, in acknowledging that we know that Iran supports terrorism. We know that Iran supports Hezbollah and the Assad regime. And it certainly is possible that some of the money that Iran has is being used for those purposes too. That\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why this administration, on the front end, has been deepening our engagement with our partners in the Middle East to counter those activities; to more effectively interdict illicit materials that could be used to support Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program; to more effectively strengthen the defenses of our partners to counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nefarious activities.\nBut the bulk of the money we know has been going to shoring up their economic weakness. And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we predicted. What has not happened, and where the critics of the deal get it wrong, is Iran has not enjoyed hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Iran has not been able to use hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief to support terrorism or to prop up the Assad regime. People who have made that prediction were either badly misinformed or lying to the American public. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to them to explain why their prediction didn\xe2\x80\x99t come true. It does explain, however, why they continue to resurface six-month-old news stories to try to justify their opposition to an agreement that has benefited the American people, both financially and when it comes to our national security.', 'Link': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hillary-clinton-accidentally-gave-isis-400-million/', 'image_info': {u'color': {u'accentColor': u'931608', u'dominantColorForeground': u'Red', u'dominantColorBackground': u'Red', u'dominantColors': [u'Red', u'White'], u'isBwImg': False}, u'requestId': u'039e38e1-c44a-48c6-829d-ffc001a1eeee', u'description': {u'captions': [{u'text': u'Hillary Clinton posing for the camera', u'confidence': 0.9181228696830429}], u'tags': [u'person', u'clothing', u'holding', u'woman', u'photo', u'standing', u'front', u'dress', u'man', u'young', u'posing', u'table', u'girl', u'orange', u'wearing', u'red', u'sign', u'bear', u'umbrella', u'phone']}, u'categories': [{u'score': 0.7578125, u'name': u'people_', u'detail': {u'celebrities': [{u'confidence': 0.9999963045120239, u'faceRectangle': {u'width': 85, u'top': 50, u'left': 229, u'height': 85}, u'name': u'Hillary Clinton'}]}}], u'metadata': {u'width': 542, u'height': 305, u'format': u'Jpeg'}}, 'id': 735}

See, many districts in this country have actually pulled back on efforts to integrate their schools, and many communities have become less diverse as folks have moved from cities to suburbs.\nSo today, by some measures, our schools are as segregated as they were back when Dr. King gave his final speech. And as a result, many young people in America are going to school largely with kids who look just like them. And too often, those schools aren\xe2\x80\x99t equal, especially ones attended by students of color which too often lag behind, with crumbling classrooms and less experienced teachers. And even in schools that seem integrated according to the numbers, when you look a little closer, you see students from different backgrounds sitting at separate lunch tables, or tracked into different classes, or separated into different clubs or activities.\nSo while students attend school in the same building, they never really reach beyond their own circles. And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that probably happens sometimes here in Topeka, too.\nNow, our laws may no longer separate us based on our skin color, but nothing in the Constitution says we have to eat together in the lunchroom, or live together in the same neighborhoods. There\xe2\x80\x99s no court case against believing in stereotypes or thinking that certain kinds of hateful jokes or comments are funny.\nSo the answers to many of our challenges today can\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be found in our laws. These changes also need to take place in our hearts and in our minds. And so, graduates, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to all of you to lead the way, to drag my generation and your grandparents\xe2\x80\x99 generation along with you.\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s really my challenge to all of you today. As you go forth, when you encounter folks who still hold the old prejudices because they\xe2\x80\x99ve only been around folks like themselves, when you meet folks who think they know all the answers because they\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard any other viewpoints, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to you to help them see things differently.\nAnd the good news is that you probably won\xe2\x80\x99t have to bring a lawsuit or go all the way to the Supreme Court to do that. You all can make a difference every day in your own lives simply by teaching others the lessons you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned here in Topeka.\nMaybe that starts simply in your own family, when grandpa tells that off-colored joke at Thanksgiving, or you\xe2\x80\x99ve got an aunt talks about \xe2\x80\x9cthose people.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, you can politely inform them that they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about your friends.\nOr maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s when you go off to college and you decide to join a sorority or fraternity, and you ask the question, how can we get more diversity in our next pledge class?

During yet another shameful episode of The 700 Club, which runs on Disney-owned channel ABC Family, Robertson received an email from a woman who claimed that her grandson disrespects their Christian faith when they visit their daughter on Christmas and chose not to visit this past year. \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody take that kid to the woodshed and let him understand the blessings of discipline,\xe2\x80\x9d he advised.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd while we\xe2\x80\x99re on the subject of beating,\xe2\x80\x9d Robertson continued shamelessly, \xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking that that might not be such a bad punishment for married women who are thinking about voting for Hillary Clinton in November\xe2\x80\x99s election.

Recently, several investigators have evaluated autohemotherapy as a treatment for urticaria and eczema. I conducted a systematic review of the literature on autohemotherapy, focusing on treatment outcomes. The available evidence indicates that autohemotherapy does not have major side effects, and that minor adverse effects are short-lived and similar in frequency to those from placebo injections. Overall, autohemotherapy tends to be somewhat more effective in reducing symptoms than control therapy across studies, although the advantage is not statistically reliable. Urticaria patients who test positive on the autologous serum skin test display a moderately better response to autohemotherapy than patients who test negative. Based on the limited evidence available, autologous whole blood and autologous serum injections appear to have similar effectiveness.

Consequently, removal of the egg\xe2\x80\x99s nucleus to make room for the donor nucleus also removes the spindle proteins, interfering with cell division. In other mammals, such as cats, rabbits and mice, the two spindle proteins are spread throughout the egg. So, removal of the egg\xe2\x80\x99s nucleus does not result in loss of spindle proteins.

They could be described as a kind of ancient underground superhighway.\nOthers think the tunnels can be seen as a gateway to the underworld., A few radiocarbon dating analyses have also been performed, and they indicate that the galleries date back to the 10th to the 13th century. Bits of charcoal recovered from the Erdstall tunnels in H\xc3\xb6cherlm\xc3\xbchle date back to the period between 950 and 1050 A.D., As a result of the international cooperation of the Erdstall working group, new clues have come to light. The galleries are also concentrated in parts of Ireland and Scotland, and there are also clusters in central France.\nThis distribution bears intriguing parallels to the routes of the Irish-Scottish traveling monks who, coming from the Celtic north in the 6th century, traveled across the continent as missionaries. The tattooed monks made the passage to the continent from the islands, carrying long staffs and wearing coarse habits.\nThe legendary Kilian, born in Ireland around 640 A.D., preached in the southern German city of W\xc3\xbcrzburg. According to a hagiography, angry natives killed him and buried him in a stable. St. Gall (died 640 A.D.) made it as far as Lake Constance.\nAhlborn speculates that these early Christian missionaries also brought along heathen ideas, the remnants of Druid scholarship or special Celtic concepts of the afterlife, which led to the construction of the subterranean galleries., In 2013, construction workers demolishing low-income homes ringing [a Byzantine-era hilltop castle in Nev\xc5\x9fehir] discovered entrances to a network of rooms and tunnels.

Artifacts including grindstones, stone crosses, and ceramics indicate the city was in use from the Byzantine era through the Ottoman conquest.\nLike Derinkuyu, the site appears to have been a large, self-sustaining complex with air shafts and water channels.

According to statistics published on the U.D.O.T website, approximately 7,342 Truck Driver fatalities occurred across the country throughout 2015.

The most common concern voiced by drivers within the impacted states is simple- they are responsible citizens who practice Truck safety and they don\xe2\x80\x99t want the government to dictate their transportation decisions.

{'Title': '\nHillary Clinton Was Responsible for the Waco Massacre?\nClinton was not in any position that would have given her authority to order or escalate the siege that ended with the deaths of 76 religious cult members in 1993.\t\t\n', 'Image': 'https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2016/09/hillary-clinton.jpg?resize=542,305', 'Content': 'On February 28, 1993, at approximately 9:30 a.m. Central Time, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) came under heavy gunfire while attempting to execute an arrest warrant for Vernon Howell, otherwise known as David Koresh. The warrant authorized Koresh\xe2\x80\x99s arrest for federal firearms and explosives violations. An accompanying search warrant authorized the ATF agents to search the compound where Koresh and his followers, known as the Branch Davidians, lived near Waco, Texas. Four ATF agents were killed and sixteen were wounded during the shootout with the Branch Davidians on February 28. Additionally, a number of individuals inside the compound were killed and injured; however, the number killed by ATF gunfire cannot be precisely determined.\nWithin a few hours of the incident, and at the request of ATF officials, the FBI dispatched trained negotiators to the scene in Waco. By that afternoon, the FBI, in cooperation with the ATF and Department of Treasury officials, had also sent in advance units of its elite Hostage Rescue Team. The next day (March 1, 1993), also at the request of Treasury Department officials, the FBI became the lead agency responsible for resolving the standoff with the Branch Davidians.\nThe Branch Davidians, an offshoot of the Seventh Day Adventists, strongly believed that the Second Coming of Christ was imminent, and that the end of the world was approaching rapidly. The Davidians had armed themselves heavily in anticipation of an apocalyptic showdown with government agents, who they likened to the Babylonians and Assyrians of Biblical times. David Koresh had been the \xe2\x80\x9cprophet\xe2\x80\x9d or leader of the Davidians since 1987.\nWhen the FBI assumed responsibility for resolving the standoff, it faced an unknown number of men, women, and children who had barricaded themselves in a large compound, and who refused to surrender. They were heavily armed with hundreds of weapons, including fully automatic machine guns and .50 caliber rifles, and with hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition. They had already demonstrated their willingness to use those weapons on February 28.\nDuring the next 51 days, over 700 law enforcement personnel participated in the effort to end the standoff. Between 250 to 300 FBI personnel were present in Waco at any given time, along with hundreds of officers and agents from other federal, state, and local agencies., \nSeven weeks after the standoff began, the Attorney General approved an FBI request to introduce nonlethal tear gas into the compound. The Attorney General based her decision on a number of factors, including the impasse in the negotiations, the extreme difficulty in maintaining a safe and secure perimeter around the compound, the risk of disease caused by deteriorating sanitary conditions in the compound, the remaining Davidians\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to leave any time in the foreseeable future, and the Davidians\xe2\x80\x99 ability to hold out for many more months, given their large stockpiles of food and water.\nThe Attorney General and her senior advisers, with input from the FBI and the U.S. military, reviewed several options before concluding that inserting tear gas was the only viable, non-lethal option. The plan was to insert gas periodically over a 48-hour period, to then withdraw, and then to wait as large numbers of people left the compound. The Attorney General approved the operation on Saturday, April 17, ordering that it be implemented beginning Monday, April 19.\nOn April 19, the FBI telephoned the compound at 5:59 a.m. to inform the Davidians that tear gas would be released into the compound, and to assure them that the FBI was not launching an assault. At 6:02 a.m., an FBI tank with an attached boom began inserting gas into the compound. The Davidians opened fire on the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle within two minutes.\nAt 12:07 p.m., the Davidians started simultaneous fires at three or more different locations within the compound. This was established by a team of independent arson experts; by video shot from an aircraft utilizing Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) technology; by observations of FBI agents who saw an individual appearing to light one of the fires; by statements from survivors admitting that the Davidians set the fires; and by [material redacted as required by statute]. The fires rapidly engulfed the compound in flames and smoke.\nAt approximately 12:25 p.m., the FBI agents closest to the compound heard what they described as \xe2\x80\x9csystematic\xe2\x80\x9d gunfire. Many agents believed at the time that those inside were killing themselves, killing each other, or both.\nThe remains of 75 individuals (50 adults and 25 children under age 15) were recovered in the ruins of the compound. At least 17 of those individuals died of gunshot wounds, including several children. Another child was stabbed to death. In addition to the 75 persons who died during the April 19 fire, five other bodies, all with gunshot wounds, also were recovered. Those five bodies were of the Davidians presumably killed during the February 28 shootout with the ATF. Some of those five bodies showed evidence of having been shot from inside the compound. At least one of those five bodies showed evidence of suicide., \nAppearing on CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Larry King Live, fmr. White House aide Linda Tripp suggested that Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster \xe2\x80\x94 at Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s direction \xe2\x80\x94 transmitted the order to move on the Branch Davidian compound, which culminated in a military style attack.\n \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a reason not to do this,\xe2\x80\x9d Janet Reno is said to have begged aides shortly before orders were issued in the final assault \xe2\x80\x94 during which 85 Branch Davidians were burned alive.\nTripp\xe2\x80\x99s allegations lend weight to charges made previously by Special Forces expert and Waco investigator, Steve Barry \xe2\x80\x94 who claimed Hillary Clinton set up a special \xe2\x80\x9ccrisis center\xe2\x80\x9d in the White House to deal with Waco., \nHillary was the one who ordered the FUBAR final assault on the holed-up Branch Davidians in Waco on April 19th, 1993. \nHillary was putting pressure on Vince Foster (her longtime boyfriend, sexual partner and emotional husband) and Webb Hubbell who was the #3 guy at Justice Department, to have a forceful resolution to the Waco standoff. Webb Hubbell is also probably the father of Chelsea, not Bill Clinton.      \nOne big reason Hillary placed Hubbell in the #3 spot at the Justice Department was so that he would not have to go through a Senate confirmation hearing where the ugly and probably true details about Hubbell being the biological father of Chelsea might be revealed in this process.\nMrs Clinton grew more and more impatient as the Waco stand-off came to dominate the headlines. Hillary wanted to get so-called \xe2\x80\x9cheath care reform\xe2\x80\x9d done, and Waco was taking all the headlines in spring., From the time the standoff at the Branch Davidian compound began on February 28, the principal headquarters responsibility in Washington for planning and decision-making lay with the Terrorism and Violent Crimes Section of the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s Criminal Division (TVCS/CRM) and the Violent Crimes and Major Offenders Section (VCMOS) of the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s Criminal Investigative Division (CID). As the Chief of the TVCS/CRM, James S. Reynolds was substantially involved, as were both Deputy Chief Mary Incontro and section attorney John Lancaster. John C. Keeney was the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division during the crisis, and Deputy Assistant Attorney General (DAAG) Mark Richard oversaw the activities of TVCS/CRM. AG Reno relied a great deal on DAAG Richard during the latter days of the crisis. The primary headquarters responsibility for decision-making throughout the crisis at the FBI lay with Director Sessions, Deputy Director Clarke, and Associate Deputy Director Gow.\nThe Attorney General believes she was adequately informed and that the FBI was forthcoming. She was impressed with the quality and timeliness of responses to her questions or to her requests for additional information. When she asked the FBI to seek input from the military, she was impressed that the FBI arranged a face-to-face briefing within two days. The FBI did not try to \xe2\x80\x9crailroad\xe2\x80\x9d her. Instead, they were respectful and seemed genuinely appreciative of the hard questions she posed. She did not believe that anyone at the FBI deliberately played up the issue of child abuse. In any event, that was only one of the many factors she considered in deciding to approve the tear-gas plan. The FBI kept an open mind, and no one ever suggested to her that they knew best or that they knew it all.', 'Link': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hillary-clinton-was-responsible-for-the-waco-massacre/', 'image_info': {u'color': {u'accentColor': u'0B94C0', u'dominantColorForeground': u'Grey', u'dominantColorBackground': u'Black', u'dominantColors': [u'Black'], u'isBwImg': False}, u'requestId': u'c31a011e-befe-484f-ae7e-041b8c1730f3', u'description': {u'captions': [{u'text': u'Hillary Clinton wearing glasses and smiling at the camera', u'confidence': 0.7669112806459667}], u'tags': [u'person', u'woman', u'holding', u'looking', u'front', u'wearing', u'man', u'lady', u'glasses', u'phone', u'standing', u'using', u'sitting', u'smiling', u'hand', u'shirt', u'laptop', u'red', u'table', u'young', u'white', u'talking', u'blue', u'food', u'eating', u'restaurant', u'street', u'plate']}, u'categories': [{u'score': 0.00390625, u'name': u'others_'}, {u'score': 0.8671875, u'name': u'people_portrait', u'detail': {u'celebrities': [{u'confidence': 0.9999926090240479, u'faceRectangle': {u'width': 129, u'top': 63, u'left': 184, u'height': 129}, u'name': u'Hillary Clinton'}]}}], u'metadata': {u'width': 542, u'height': 305, u'format': u'Jpeg'}}, 'id': 836}

And Bernie Sanders was independent candidate trying to get the nomination trough the Democratic Party and if you ask me he did get the nomination, but he was threatened to drop out!\nPilger: What do you mean by that will your next leak contain information about Bernie Sanders?\nAssange: Of course we\xe2\x80\x99re very interested in revealing the truth about any candidate and yes we have some material about Bernie Sanders that will be published!\nAssange isn\xe2\x80\x99t focusing entirely on Clinton however, urging anyone with information on Bernie Sanders to come forward!, In America, the problem for the thousands of followers of Bernie Sanders was the Democratic Party, not to mention their ultimate betrayal by their great white hope. In the US, home of the great civil rights and anti-war movements, it is Black Lives Matter and the likes of Codepink that lay the roots of a modern version., Finally, Julian, we cut you off earlier when you were talking about what you felt were the most significant emails that you have released. Is there any last one that you\xe2\x80\x99d like to mention? And also, do you have any thoughts on Donald Trump? I mean, just before we went to air, a CNN poll came out that says Donald Trump is ahead by 5 percentage points of Hillary Clinton. Now, he did just come off of the Republican convention, but many called it the worst convention in history, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not automatic that he should have had this percentage lead. Of course, though, you have the crisis, the disarray, the Democratic Party is in because of these emails that you\xe2\x80\x99ve released., Look, I think \xe2\x80\x94 you know, we know how politics works in the United States. Whoever \xe2\x80\x94 whatever political party gets into government is going to merge with the bureaucracy pretty damn fast. It will be in a position where it has some levers in its hand. And so, as a result, corporate lobbyists will move in to help control those levers. So it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make much difference in the end. What does make a difference is political accountability, a general deterrence set to stop political organizations behaving in a corrupt manner. That can make a difference, because that changes the perception of what you can do or not do. And so, always \xe2\x80\x94 well, almost always, you should choose the principled position, which is to set a disciplinary signal about acting in a corrupt way, and take a philosophical position, which is our institutions can only be as good as our understanding of our institutions.\nThe other top emails, well, as I said, I think this instruction by Luis Miranda, the head of communications, to go out and covertly spread anti-Bernie Sanders propaganda is a clear instruction combined with a chain of command. It\xe2\x80\x99s not simply expressing a sentiment. It is expressing an instruction within the DNC to subvert the Bernie Sanders campaign.\nThen there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of emails about the close relationship between the DNC and the media \xe2\x80\x94 The Washington Post involved in a co-fundraising party, an off-list co-fundraising for the DNC, calling up MSNBC during the middle of a program and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cPull that segment now,\xe2\x80\x9d Debbie Wasserman Schultz calling up the president of MSNBC in order to discipline Morning Joe, etc. That\xe2\x80\x99s, you know, of course, something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all suspected happens, but this is concrete proof of it.', 'Link': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/julian-assange-bernie-sanders-was-threatened/', 'image_info': {u'color': {u'accentColor': u'696265', u'dominantColorForeground': u'Black', u'dominantColorBackground': u'Grey', u'dominantColors': [u'Black', u'Grey'], u'isBwImg': False}, u'requestId': u'f126ad25-a9c9-40f8-a705-b8d39ad7f25d', u'description': {u'captions': [{u'text': u'Julian Assange smiling for the camera', u'confidence': 0.839545405581556}], u'tags': [u'person', u'man', u'photo', u'wearing', u'front', u'holding', u'smiling', u'posing', u'standing', u'suit', u'black', u'camera', u'computer', u'shirt', u'large', u'white', u'young']}, u'categories': [{u'score': 0.34375, u'name': u'people_', u'detail': {u'celebrities': [{u'confidence': 0.9991540908813477, u'faceRectangle': {u'width': 117, u'top': 78, u'left': 223, u'height': 117}, u'name': u'Julian Assange'}]}}, {u'score': 0.625, u'name': u'people_portrait', u'detail': {u'celebrities': [{u'confidence': 0.9991540908813477, u'faceRectangle': {u'width': 117, u'top': 78, u'left': 223, u'height': 117}, u'name': u'Julian Assange'}]}}], u'metadata': {u'width': 542, u'height': 305, u'format': u'Jpeg'}}, 'id': 843}

That\xe2\x80\x99s not what we want for our kids, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, at the end of the day, what condoms actually do is they give our kids a false sense of security, they\xe2\x80\x99re actually tricking them into thinking they\xe2\x80\x99re having safe sex, when in fact, very often, those intercourses result in unwanted teen pregnancies. And the reason why that\xe2\x80\x99s happening is because condoms are designed to be hip, to be modern, to be practical and what not, and the truth is that that\xe2\x80\x99s a lie. The only way to stay safe from premature pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases is to practice abstinence and pray to God, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only real way to stay safe,\xe2\x80\x9d Pence argued. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the day, it\xe2\x80\x99s the unjustified trust in condoms that plays a huge part in abortion rates going through the roof\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xa0If you want to risk ruining your life before it\xe2\x80\x99s even started, go ahead, gamble with condoms. But I say we need to ban them and make the right decision for those who clearly aren\xe2\x80\x99t capable of making it themselves. What we don\xe2\x80\x99t need are condoms that are unsafe; what we DO need are smarter kids, apparently,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.', 'Link': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/mike-pence-condom-ban/', 'image_info': {u'color': {u'accentColor': u'C20969', u'dominantColorForeground': u'White', u'dominantColorBackground': u'White', u'dominantColors': [u'White', u'Pink'], u'isBwImg': False}, u'requestId': u'36dc047c-ce0a-4b10-bb11-711acc84878e', u'description': {u'captions': [{u'text': u'Mike Pence holding an object in her hand', u'confidence': 0.25583900171363005}], u'tags': [u'holding']}, u'categories': [{u'score': 0.00390625, u'name': u'others_'}, {u'score': 0.34375, u'name': u'text_menu'}, {u'score': 0.1640625, u'name': u'text_sign'}], u'metadata': {u'width': 542, u'height': 305, u'format': u'Jpeg'}}, 'id': 863}

How many times can Neil deGrasse Tyson win the internet?\nThe epic science burn happened toward the end of one of Neil\xe2\x80\x99s lectures at the Hayden Planetarium in New York last weekend.

Bush, serving on commissions to advise him on the future of the American aerospace Industry, on NASA, and on the annual Presidential Medial of science winners. So your disapproval of my views is not shared by others on the conservative spectrum.\n7) Lastly: my research output as a scientist is not hidden. You can find it here, if you are interested: http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/curriculum-vitae\nSo when you factor in (or simply subtract) all these elements from your writeup, If what remains still justifies labeling me a horses astrophysicist, then, as I said, I\xe2\x80\x99m okay with that.\nRespectfully Submitted,\nNeil deGrasse Tyson, New York City\np.s.

The man we have in custody was reported deceased in 2007 after being shot in an attempted bank robbery, \xe2\x80\x9cone source speaking on anonymity said.\nThe New York Times reported on April 6, 2007 that Barry Bush, a veteran F.B.I. agent on a bank-robbery detail was fatally wounded apparently when another agent\xe2\x80\x99s weapon accidentally discharged during a confrontation with three gunmen outside a bank in a quiet town in central New Jersey., While the circumstances were still under investigation, a statement by the F.B.I. said that the agent, Barry Lee Bush, 52, of the bureau\xe2\x80\x99s Newark office, \xe2\x80\x9cmay have been fatally wounded as a result of the accidental discharge of another agent\xe2\x80\x99s weapon during a dynamic arrest situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the 99-year history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Bush, who was married and the father of two grown children, was the 51st agent killed in the line of duty, and the first to be fatally shot in 10 years. He had worked for the bureau for almost 20 years, in Newark, Kansas City, Mo., and elsewhere., According to a spokesman at the Newark FBI field office, Bush was killed in the line of duty in April of 2007. Coincidentally, five minutes after we got off the phone with him, a page honoring FBI agents who were killed in the line of duty, went down on the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s website.\nIt is not clear what Bush\xe2\x80\x99s intentions were for sneaking around security to presumably access the service elevators at the Trump Tower, however it does not take much imagination as to why Bush was carrying a silenced pistol at the time of his arrest.\nTrump is in Florida today for rallies in Daytona Beach and Jacksonville. Trump has informed us that he was not at the Trump Tower yesterday evening and did not have any information about the incident, other than an armed man had been arrested at his building and that it was not clear about what Bush\xe2\x80\x99s intentions were., Neither my wife and or I have any experience as writers. Although I have wrote and been highly praised on several of the articles I have written on this site, the majority of the articles you will find on this web site are articles from main stream media sources, that my wife and I have removed the bullshit about Donald Trump from and replaced the same with the actual truth.\nOf course, any time we find the opportunity to bash his opponents, we definitely take advantage of all the liberties afforded to us by our Free Speech rights \xe2\x80\xa6 the same rights these scumbags take advantage of to heap a mound of bullshit on Mr. Trump.\nShoveling up the bullshit, while informing the general public of the truth about Donald J. Trump and having some fun in the process, is the primary mission of Get off the BS. Thank you so much for stopping by. Trump for President 2016., Frankly, we don\xe2\x80\x99t give a damn if you believe what we write or not. We challenge you to call BS if you have concrete proof we have published bullshit.

With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour.

However, if you\xe2\x80\x99re nevertheless feeling a slight twinge of guilt for gobbling up all the bandwith, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to suggest a simple path to atonement. I run a modest foundation called @mikeroweWORKS. We award work ethic scholarships to people who wish to learn a skill that\xe2\x80\x99s actually in demand. So far, we\xe2\x80\x99ve distributed over $3 million dollars for the kind of training that gets tradespeople jobs. Anyway, my approach to fund raising is what you might call \xe2\x80\x9cnon-traditional.\xe2\x80\x9d Yesterday, I auctioned off an old bathrobe, stolen from a swanky spa in Napa for $8,405.00. Check it out. http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/252381732048\xe2\x80\xa6\nThis got me thinking \xe2\x80\x93 how much might someone bid for a bathrobe from The Trump Tower? (I took my Mom and Dad there a few months ago, and they had a ball. My Dad still has your slippers, and refuses to part with them.)\nI\xe2\x80\x99d like to make a deal. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a spare robe in the hotel inventory that you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to part with, I\xe2\x80\x99d love to auction it off for the benefit of mikeroweWORKS. What do you say? Might be fun to see what someone would pay for a Trump bathrobe that rewards work ethic. I guarantee that millions of voters will see the auction, and thousands of dollars will be raised. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be Yuge!\nPPS.

Full disclosure \xe2\x80\x93 If Hillary and Bernie sent me a pantsuit and a rumpled jacket \xe2\x80\x93 respectively \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99d auction those off in heartbeat\xe2\x80\xa6, &lt;iframe style="border: none; overflow: hidden;" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTheRealMikeRowe%2Fvideos%2Fvb.116999698310182%2F1237275509615923%2F%3Ftype%3D3&amp;amp;show_text=0&amp;amp;width=560" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\nAs some of you might recall, I auctioned off my ratty old bathrobe several months ago, which raised $8,500 dollars for our scholarship fund. Shortly thereafter, I commented that a better bathrobe, one from Trump Tower and signed by Donald J. Trump, just might raise enough money to close the skills gap. (I also suggested that a tasteful pantsuit from Hillary Clinton, or a similar bathrobe from President Bill Clinton \xe2\x80\x93 either of which I\xe2\x80\x99d happily model \xe2\x80\x93 would be a most welcome auction item for mikeroweWORKS.)\nWell, thanks to the magical synapses of social media, I am now in receipt of a genuine Trump bathrobe \xe2\x80\x93 hand delivered to me a few weeks ago in Baltimore, by a whirling dervish named Tana Goertz who works for Mr. Trump. As the attached video attests, Donald Trump is not only aware of mikeroweWORKS, he supports our objectives, and apparently took my challenge at face value.\xa0, Hillary refused to send anything and then gave Rowe a call. She had a conversation with him about the charity and determined she would not donate. Mike Rowe then asked her if she had any Christian values. She refused to answer.

{'Title': "\nPok\xc3\xa9mon Was Originally Designed for Satanists\nA satirical 2012 interview with Pok\xc3\xa9mon's creator has reappeared thanks to the popularity of Pok\xc3\xa9mon GO.\t\t\n", 'Image': 'https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2016/07/pokesatan.jpg?resize=542,305', 'Content': 'In a rare interview with\xa0Pok\xc3\xa9mon creator Satoshi Tajiri, he admits that the games were created as a backlash against his Christian parents. He also says that the games are tailored towards an anti-Christian sentiment or Satanism.\nThe interview, conducted by Time about the continued success of the\xa0Pok\xc3\xa9mon series, took a sharp left turn when Tajiri was asked about the inspiration for the games. The following is an excerpt from the interview:\n[\xe2\x80\xa6]\nTajiri: Yes. Pok\xc3\xa9mon is essentially the correct answer towards life, not Christianity. Everything presented in the game is the opposite of what Christians may believe. Some have said that the game promotes voodoo or magic, and I agree in the sense that there are many things that occur in nature that are unexplainable. Furthermore, the violence in the games is unparalleled. It may not show up in the actual graphics, but the brutality is made especially explicit in the Pok\xc3\xa9dex entries. Nature, again, played a big role.\nTime: So those who say that the game is anti-Christian are correct?\nTajiri: I suppose so. I mean, some could say that the game supports Satanism. I don\xe2\x80\x99t officially celebrate it, but I can understand why people would be attracted to it., After first coming up with the idea for Pok\xc3\xa9mon in 1990, Satoshi Tajiri labored for nearly six years over the original game. Now 34, he based it partly on things he remembered as a kid. The careful attention paid off. Pok\xc3\xa9mon swept Japan and is now doing the same in the U.S. and beyond. Spinoffs include trading cards as closely held as stock options, a TV series and, now, a movie., It\xe2\x80\x99s the way I work. I sleep 12 hours and then work 24 hours. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked those irregular hours for the past three years. It\xe2\x80\x99s better to stay up day and night to come up with ideas.

The LAPD released a public statement stating , \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d like to apologize to Dwayne Johnson for the inconvenience. Any time the LAPD receives a call, it is our responsibility to make sure it is treated in the most serious manner.

Turnbolt organized the nighttime vigil; he had found solidarity with ISIS combatants during a year-long sojourn to Syria, where he witnessed the harsh and inhumane conditions under which ISIS soldiers operate. Turnbolt rejected the word \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist,\xe2\x80\x9d preferring the word \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom fighters\xe2\x80\x9d to describe his heavily-armed, bomb wielding comrades.klug-vigil-armsup_mid\nProfessor Turnbolt distributed flyers and hung posters across southern California\xe2\x80\x99s largest campus, encouraging students to abandon preconceived hatred and instead adopt tolerance and understanding under the banner of cultural diversity.  The ISIS vigil was so successful it even attracted supporters from other California schools.,  &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1traMrr46rg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\nThe UCLA campus community filled Bruin Plaza to share messages of solidarity and healing in a candlelight ceremony honoring the memory of professor William Klug, who was shot and killed in his office a day earlier.\nStudents and members of the public listened to speakers and circled a growing memorial of flowers and hand-written messages placed at the Bruin statue. The crowd thronged into the plaza shortly after sunset and lined the second and third-floor walkways of the Wooden Center. The \xe2\x80\x9cBruin Strong\xe2\x80\x9d vigil was organized by the Undergraduate Students Association Council and the Graduate Student Association. Professor Klug was a beloved member of the mechanical and aerospace engineering faculty.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us illuminate the night with the unity and strength and perseverance of our Bruin family,\xe2\x80\x9d said Danny Siegel, student body president and third year political science major. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not an event we will quickly get over. It will take time to heal the sadness that has cloaked our campus, but we will heal it together. Let there always be light.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe evening\xe2\x80\x99s messages were of gratitude and commendation for the first responders, and love and solidarity as the campus grieves and come to grips with the murder of a popular and promising young professor. Klug is survived by his wife and two children aged seven and nine.

Before deciding to change the colour of her eyeballs, Garth had experimented with a number of body modifications including face tattoos, piercings, elf-like pointed ears and a bifurcated tongue.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was mentally intense,\xe2\x80\x9d she says of the several injections needed to colour her eyeballs a delicate blue-green, a colour she refers to as sea foam.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like somebody is poking at your eye, then it feels like strange pressure and then it feels you have a bit of sand in your eye, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no pain.\xe2\x80\x9d, First and foremost, I, Luna Cobra, am the inventor of eyeball, or sclera, tattooing (tattooing the white of the eye in a solid or mix of colours). I first attempted the procedure on sighted human eyeballs in 2007 on three well-informed and consenting parties. Since then, I have fine-tuned both the technique and materials to increase the safety and minimize the risks of tattooing the eyeball. There are still risks involved, of course, but in the 8 years I have been performing this procedure, all my clients are all still ok.\nSecondly, I personally have not trained anyone else to do this procedure. I have appeared on various tv/news segments though, and\xa0have inspired many copycats worldwide. This is important to know because without the proper education, training, experience and\xa0guidance, these practitioners have caused vision impairments like blurred vision, spots or floaters, and even blindness. YES PEOPLE ARE NOW BLIND FROM EYEBALL TATTOOING., Permanent colouring of unsightly corneal scars has been known for almost 2000 years.\xa0\xa0During the final decade of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century it was a commonly applied technique.\xa0Owing to the tremendous progress in microsurgical reconstructive procedures, corneal tattooing today will only apply for a minor and carefully selected group of patients.\xa0, Using the injection method of eyeball tattooing, where a larger area of ink is injected via a single hole, complex designs are not possible, and although fades from one color to another are possible to some extent, they can be difficult to control and master. The difficulty in controlling the spread of the ink makes this method inadvisable for the cornea (ie. over the iris and pupil) because of the danger of obscuring vision if the ink spreads over the pupil. Because only a few injections are required to completely cover the white of an eye with ink, many of the risks in the traditional method such as significant ink loss and ulceration are largely mitigated (although they are not eliminated). However, the injections can be difficult to control, and over-injection or injections that are too deep or too shallow carry significant risk \xe2\x80\x94 the appropriate zone is less than a millimetre thick, with serious consequences for missing it.\nThe medical community uses almost exclusively the traditional tattoo method \xe2\x80\x94 although even after 150 years they have not come up with an agreed upon technique, which is very telling \xe2\x80\x94 whereas the body modification community uses almost exclusively the injection method. To date, attempts to tattoo the white of the eye using traditional needle methods have been extremely unsatistfactory, almost completely falling out. The general consensus is that injection is the only acceptable method of scleral tattooing.', 'Link': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/eyeball-tattoos/', 'image_info': {u'color': {u'accentColor': u'5D6E6D', u'dominantColorForeground': u'Grey', u'dominantColorBackground': u'Grey', u'dominantColors': [u'Grey'], u'isBwImg': False}, u'requestId': u'7b6334fb-40c5-4631-8718-c8015727e1dd', u'description': {u'captions': [{u'text': u'a man looking at the camera', u'confidence': 0.8583469274029137}], u'tags': [u'person', u'man', u'looking', u'standing', u'camera', u'couple', u'people', u'holding', u'wearing', u'posing', u'group', u'suit', u'talking', u'young', u'red', u'white', u'woman', u'shirt', u'wedding']}, u'categories': [{u'score': 0.96484375, u'name': u'people_portrait', u'detail': {u'celebrities': []}}], u'metadata': {u'width': 542, u'height': 305, u'format': u'Png'}}, 'id': 987}

The incident occurred around 6 p.m. yesterday according to reports. Krueger had taken her 6-year-old son, Daniel Krueger, to the restaurant to get him dinner. Afterwards, she left her son at the table to eat as she went to the restroom. According to eyewitnesses her 6-year-old son was crying because he was unable to locate his Transformers Happy Meal toy.

That number is expected to grow as the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s office continues to review gun laws across the country, to see which states would be a danger to visitors.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe see states like Florida, who have no magazine-clip capacity limit.

We allowed them to be sold out of state, but then realized that all of the other states now have these dangerous magazine-clips. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s best that New Yorkers simply stay in New York where everyone only has magazine-clips that hold 10 or less rounds. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to risk exposing them to the same magazine-clips that we were trying to get rid of in the first place.

Causes of deaths included seven SIDS, and one of each of the following: enteritis, Leigh Syndrome, adrenogenital syndrome, cardiac arrest, motor vehicle accident, and accidental drowning. All of these events occurred more than two weeks post immunization. The rate of SIDS observed in the German case-control study was 0.4/1,000 vaccinated infants. The rate of SIDS observed in the US open-label safety study was 0.8/1,000 vaccinated infants and the reported rate of SIDS in the US from 1985-1991 was 1.5/1,000 live births. By chance alone, some cases of SIDS can be expected to follow receipt of whole-cell pertussis DTP35 or DTaP vaccines., The ADVERSE REACTIONS section must list adverse reactions identified from domestic and foreign spontaneous reports. This listing must be separate from the listing of adverse reactions identified in clinical trials and must also be preceded by information necessary to interpret the adverse reactions. To help practitioners interpret the significance of data obtained from postmarketing spontaneous reports, the following statement, or an appropriate modification, should precede these data:\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations 8 The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of drug X. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure., A prominent British medical journal retracted a 1998 research paper that set off a sharp decline in vaccinations in Britain after the paper\xe2\x80\x99s lead author suggested that vaccines could cause autism.\nThe retraction by The Lancet is part of a reassessment that has lasted for years of the scientific methods and financial conflicts of Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who contended that his research showed that the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine may be unsafe.\nTom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the retraction of Dr. Wakefield\xe2\x80\x99s study \xe2\x80\x9csignificant.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt builds on the overwhelming body of research by the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading scientists that concludes there is no link between M.M.R. vaccine and autism,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Skinner wrote.\nA British medical panel concluded that Dr. Wakefield had been dishonest, violated basic research ethics rules and showed a \xe2\x80\x9ccallous disregard\xe2\x80\x9d for the suffering of children involved in his research.\nDr. Wakefield\xe2\x80\x99s paper reported on his examinations of 12 children with chronic intestinal disorders who had a history of normal development followed by severe mental regressions. But an investigation by a British journalist found financial and scientific conflicts that Dr. Wakefield did not reveal in his paper. For instance, part of the costs of Dr. Wakefield\xe2\x80\x99s research were paid by lawyers for parents seeking to sue vaccine makers for damages. Dr. Wakefield was also found to have patented in 1997 a measles vaccine that would succeed if the combined vaccine were withdrawn or discredited., An academic journal is not a collection of blank pages on to which authors inscribe important scientific facts as they discover them. Rather, science is made and shaped as authors consider the declared areas of interest, impact factors, and instructions for authors of candidate journals for their work and as the papers they submit clear the successive hurdles of eligibility screening, selection of peer reviewers, responding to reviewers\xe2\x80\x99 comments, statistical approval, technical editing, and distribution of press releases. A graph showing first a precipitous fall in immunisation rates in the United Kingdom and then a corresponding rise in the incidence of measles was later reproduced in the broadsheets (and in at least one GCSE biology syllabus) as an iconic symbol of bad science., Once the article appeared with the Lancet kitemark \xe2\x80\x94 cautious accompanying editorial notwithstanding \xe2\x80\x94 the arguments were considered by many to be proved, and the ghastly social drama of the demon vaccine took on a life of its own., In 1998, Andrew Wakefield and 12 of his colleagues published a case series in the Lancet, which suggested that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine may predispose to behavioral regression and pervasive developmental disorder in children. Despite the small sample size (n=12), the uncontrolled design, and the speculative nature of the conclusions, the paper received wide publicity, and MMR vaccination rates began to drop because parents were concerned about the risk of autism after vaccination.\nAlmost immediately afterward, epidemiological studies were conducted and published, refuting the posited link between MMR vaccination and autism. The logic that the MMR vaccine may trigger autism was also questioned because a temporal link between the two is almost predestined: both events, by design (MMR vaccine) or definition (autism), occur in early childhood.\nThe next episode in the saga was a short retraction of the interpretation of the original data by 10 of the 12 co-authors of the paper. According to the retraction, \xe2\x80\x9cno causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient\xe2\x80\x9d. This was accompanied by an admission by the Lancet that Wakefield et al. had failed to disclose financial interests (e.g., Wakefield had been funded by lawyers who had been engaged by parents in lawsuits against vaccine-producing companies). However, the Lancet exonerated Wakefield and his colleagues from charges of ethical violations and scientific misconduct.\nThe Lancet completely retracted the Wakefield et al. paper in February 2010, admitting that several elements in the paper were incorrect, contrary to the findings of the earlier investigation. Wakefield et al. were held guilty of ethical violations (they had conducted invasive investigations on the children without obtaining the necessary ethical clearances) and scientific misrepresentation (they reported that their sampling was consecutive when, in fact, it was selective). This retraction was published as a small, anonymous paragraph in the journal, on behalf of the editors.\nThe final episode in the saga is the revelation that Wakefield et al. were guilty of deliberate fraud (they picked and chose data that suited their case; they falsified facts). The British Medical Journal has published a series of articles on the exposure of the fraud, which appears to have taken place for financial gain. It is a matter of concern that the expos\xc3\xa9 was a result of journalistic investigation, rather than academic vigilance followed by the institution of corrective measures. Readers may be interested to learn that the journalist on the Wakefield case, Brian Deer, had earlier reported on the false implication of thiomersal (in vaccines) in the etiology of autism. However, Deer had not played an investigative role in that report.', 'Link': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/autism-is-now-disclosed-as-dtap-side-effect/', 'image_info': {u'color': {u'accentColor': u'75507B', u'dominantColorForeground': u'White', u'dominantColorBackground': u'White', u'dominantColors': [u'White', u'Grey'], u'isBwImg': False}, u'requestId': u'8d767551-5739-4a28-8186-8b84cdc922ac', u'description': {u'captions': [{u'text': u'a woman in a white shirt', u'confidence': 0.865830261562997}], u'tags': [u'person', u'clothing', u'woman', u'outdoor', u'looking', u'food', u'shirt', u'standing', u'table', u'holding', u'young', u'man', u'wearing', u'cake', u'girl', u'glasses', u'people', u'phone', u'talking', u'plate', u'eating', u'cutting', u'white', u'red']}, u'categories': [{u'score': 0.3984375, u'name': u'people_', u'detail': {u'celebrities': []}}, {u'score': 0.35546875, u'name': u'people_portrait', u'detail': {u'celebrities': []}}], u'metadata': {u'width': 542, u'height': 305, u'format': u'Jpeg'}}, 'id': 1060}

We put forward bold and practical solutions to big problems, like retiring our debt and fixing a broken immigration system. This has been a problem solver\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\nHowever, the centerpiece of my campaign has been securing our nation. I got into this race to put forward a plan to win a war we cannot afford to lose and to turn back the tide of isolationism that was rising in our party. I believe we\xe2\x80\x99ve made enormous progress in this effort.\nFour months ago at the very first debate, I said that any candidate that did not understand that we need more American troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria to defeat ISIL was not ready to be commander-in-chief. At that time, no one stepped forward to join me. Today, most of my fellow candidates have come to recognize this is what\xe2\x80\x99s needed to secure our homeland.\nI am far more confident today that our party will reject the Obama doctrine of leading from behind and will provide the strong leadership America needs to restore our military, take the fight to our enemies and do what it takes to make our country safe and preserve our way of life.\nThis is a generational struggle that demands a strategy and the will to win. I will continue to work every day to ensure that our party \xe2\x80\x94 and our nation \xe2\x80\x94 takes on this fight.

This comes just days after a gunman opened fire inside a classroom at a rural Oregon community college, killing nine people and injuring nine others before committing suicide after a shootout with police.\n\xe2\x80\x9cToday I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to announce the \xe2\x80\x98Mass Shooting Bill\xe2\x80\x99, which will prevent the media and it\xe2\x80\x99s [sic] coverage from naming the suspect or perpetrator in horrible tragedies like the recent Oregon shooting. If it is some kind of sick fame these individuals desire then that fame is what will be denied,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cWith the shooting in Oregon, it is important to remember the 9 innocent lives that were lost that day. We must think of heroes like Chris Mintz, who was shot seven times while saving lives and survived, all on his son\xe2\x80\x99s sixth birthday.

President Obama plans to bring in 85,000 refugees next year; including 10,000 from ISIS controlled territory in Syria.\nThe smallest city on the list, Menominee, MI, with a population of just over 8,500 residents, will feel the greatest impact. With 4,500 refugees accepted for relocation, Menominee will see its demographics drastically change almost overnight. City leaders in Menominee have agreed to fund a mosque/school for Muslim refugees, utilizing one of the many empty, unused buildings in the downtown area. Volunteers from the United Way will provide care packages and will help refugees adjust to life in small town America.,   A story circulating on the Internet and flying through Facebook regarding 4,500 Syrian refugees coming to Menominee is not true, according to a Menominee city official.

Pronounced sow-in, Samhain is a Gaelic word meaning \xe2\x80\x98end of the summer\xe2\x80\x99. This festival is believed to have been a celebration of the end of the harvest, and a time of preparation for the coming winter.\nIt is widely accepted that the early church missionaries chose to hold a festival at this time of year in order to absorb existing native Pagan practices into Christianity, thereby smoothing the conversion process.\nA letter Pope Gregory I sent to Bishop Mellitus in the 6th century, in which he suggested that existing places of non-Christian worship be adopted and consecrated to serve a Christian purpose, is often provided as supporting evidence of this method of acculturation.\nEncyclopaedia Britannica states that this date may have been chosen \xe2\x80\x9cin an effort to supplant the Pagan holiday with a Christian observance\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe Oxford Dictionary of World Religions also claims that Hallowe\xe2\x80\x99en \xe2\x80\x9cabsorbed and adopted the Celtic new year festival, the eve and day of Samhain\xe2\x80\x9d.\nHowever, there are supporters of the view that Hallowe\xe2\x80\x99en, as the eve of All Saints\xe2\x80\x99 Day, originated entirely independently of Samhain and some question the existence of a specific pan-Celtic religious festival which took place on 31st October/1st November. , c.1745, Scottish shortening of Allhallow-even \xe2\x80\x9cEve of All Saints, last night of October\xe2\x80\x9d (1550s), the last night of the year in the old Celtic calendar, where it was Old Year\xe2\x80\x99s Night, a night for witches. A pagan holiday given a cursory baptism and sent on its way., Anoka, Minnesota is believed to be the first city in the United States to put on a Halloween celebration to divert its youngsters from Halloween pranks. When Anokans awoke to find their cows roaming Main Street, their windows soaped and their outhouses tipped over, they decided something had to be done.\nIn 1920, George Green and other Anoka civic leaders suggested the idea of a giant celebration. The idea was adopted by the Anoka Commercial Club and the Anoka Kiwanis Club; both giving their full support. In September of that year, a Halloween committee was organized.', 'Link': 'https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/666th-halloween/', 'image_info': {u'color': {u'accentColor': u'384561', u'dominantColorForeground': u'Black', u'dominantColorBackground': u'Brown', u'dominantColors': [u'Black', u'Brown'], u'isBwImg': False}, u'requestId': u'38a6170b-a724-4818-a278-6ee47cbfa154', u'description': {u'captions': [{u'text': u'a group of people around each other', u'confidence': 0.8137538782616418}], u'tags': [u'person', u'child', u'woman', u'girl', u'standing', u'young', u'food', u'people', u'small', u'group', u'little', u'cake', u'table', u'holding', u'birthday', u'orange', u'school', u'man', u'kitchen', u'plate', u'playing', u'room']}, u'categories': [{u'score': 0.484375, u'name': u'people_crowd', u'detail': {u'celebrities': []}}, {u'score': 0.35546875, u'name': u'people_group', u'detail': {u'celebrities': []}}], u'metadata': {u'width': 542, u'height': 305, u'format': u'Jpeg'}}, 'id': 1227}

Both of those charges stem from a case in Roselle involving a child between the ages of 13 and 17, court records show.\nRoselle police declined to talk about the animal cruelty charge because they said it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the case with the child.  But a spokesman with the state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office confirmed Beckmann is accused of sexually abusing the peacock.\nWhen and how Phyl died is unclear. But Roselle police indicated they saw the bird\xe2\x80\x99s body in the garage of Beckmann\xe2\x80\x99s home on the night of April 28, according to court records. Police had seen the bird alive at the home before that date.

The comment with regard to the recently manufactured image with comparison to LGBT men raising the rainbow flag and the Soldiers at Iwo Jima raising the American flag.,   With the major publicity of the Iwo Jima/gay pride flag comparison photo going viral, it is a disappointment to me that, what appeared to be Jennifer Aniston\xe2\x80\x99s account is receiving all the attention from a powerful statement stolen from my original post. It is why, when the post was stolen by the owner of this Jennifer Aniston account, I made the comment that I did not appreciate the post being taken from my page \xe2\x80\x94 DV Dan \xe2\x80\x94 without any credit.\nAs the statement was made by myself, an actual U.S. Marine Veteran, it would have been nice to direct that attention to a much higher cause than gossip. Such as the fight we continue to face daily in the Veteran community. Our goal with Dysfunctional Veterans, DV Farm, DV Radio, and DV TV is to bring awareness to the estimated 23 a day. Suicide prevention and veteran support is something that actually needs the national attention behind it, not the color of a celebrity dress.\nAs I made the post I did based on how I felt the depiction of the pride flag being raised in that manner disrespected the Marines and Navy Corpsman that fought, bled, and gave the ultimate sacrifice during WWII. The original post had been pulled due to constant reporting of it, and I was getting messages from veterans who felt offended by the depiction. They were offended due to not reading my words condemning the picture, they just saw the image and, like myself, knew it was wrong. I will state again that I have nothing against the LGBT community, however as it is their right to publicly call out what they find offensive to their cause. It is my same right to express what I feel is offensive to the veteran community. As it is also their right to portray \xe2\x80\x9cArt\xe2\x80\x9d in any fashion, there should have been more respect and consideration given toward the Men and Women that protect those constitutional rights.\nYou may not agree with my views on this issue, however, one should not be hypocritical in the ways others express their views. Hate can be a two way street, not one with a one way sign. I hope the real Jennifer Aniston will see this message and contact me as she is gaining a lot of support for my statement.\nIt would be a nice gesture to show her what we do within the DV community to bring both humor and seriousness into Veteran lives through the Dysfunctional Veterans Facebook Page.

{'Title': '\nDid Jim Nabors and Rock Hudson Get Married?\nA 1970s celebrity rumor played on the not widely known personal lives of its two targets.\t\t\n', 'Image': 'https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2014/05/Untitled-design-11.jpg?resize=542,305', 'Content': '\nThere appears to be a couple of elderly, or middle-aged homosexuals who live in Huntington Beach, which is just down the coast from Los Angeles, who every year give a party, a big party, 500 people or so. And they invite everyone they know. It\xe2\x80\x99s an engraved invitation, and to make it amusing they will say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re cordially invited to the coronation of Queen Elizabeth in Huntington Beach.\xe2\x80\x9d One year the invitation was, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are cordially invited to the wedding reception of Rock Hudson and Jim Nabors.\xe2\x80\x9d And it went all over the country.\nGo all over the country it did. A fan magazine picked up on the invites and ran an item which named no names but alluded to the wedding of two same-sex stars. Other gossipmongers spread the word, including a Chicago disk jockey who described the participants as \xe2\x80\x9csort of the rock of Hollywood\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca plain guy \xe2\x80\xa6 just neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d That the joke should have explained itself escaped notice: very few picked up on the idea that hunky Mr. Hudson would hereinafter be known as \xe2\x80\x9cRock Pyle,\xe2\x80\x9d once again proving the adage no joke is so obvious that some won\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\n, \n[More] recently, [Nabors] and Rock Hudson have been the victims of a vicious, unfounded and unwarranted story linking them with a non-existent homosexual marriage.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I say?\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like a nightmare, a bad dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so ridiculous, yet so horrible, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say. Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s untrue. But how do you convince people of something like that? What do you do about a story as horrible as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe story of Nabors\xe2\x80\x99 supposed affiliation with Hudson began several months ago when a fan magazine carried an article which, without mentioning any names, led readers to believe it was written about Nabors and Hudson.\nNabors confided that his first reaction to the story was to sue for libel and slander, a tactic currently being pursued by Rock Hudson who has reportedly hired a battery of lawyers to gather evidence (or lack of evidence) for a future legal battle.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9c[my manager] talked me out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d his manager added. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would we gain?\xe2\x80\x9d All it would accomplish would be to draw attention to it. You sue a fan magazine and you get nowhere. Nobody cares and they have ten lawsuits in front of you. It would take years to get it into court, and then, by that time, so what?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen Rock Hudson since two seasons ago when he did my television show.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNabors shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cAs God is my witness, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done anything to hurt anybody. Why would somebody do something like this to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love kids,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so busy with my career that I really haven\xe2\x80\x99t given marriage much thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\n, \n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard it from a woman who heard it through her hairdresser. Then all of a sudden I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a lot of mail about the whole stupid situation. It is absolutely preposterous and ridiculous. It has reached such tremendous proportions, there\xe2\x80\x99s really nothing to say. Despite our denials,\xe2\x80\x9d Rock said, \xe2\x80\x9csome people are going to believe whatever they want to believe.

{'Title': '\nMutated Fukushima Giant Hornet Responsible For Multiple Nebraska Casualties?\nHave giant mutant killer hornets created by exposure to radiation from the Fukushima nuclear plant killed several people in Nebraska?\t\t\n', 'Image': 'https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/giant_hornet_feature.jpg?resize=542,305', 'Content': 'Is it true that giant mutant Fukushima hornets are killing people in the United States?, In the wake of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most catastrophic nuclear disaster, hospitals in central Nebraska have recently been reporting several deaths caused by a particularly venomous species of Asian wasp that has found its way into the states.It was reported that these pests have been contaminated by radioactive debris from the failed Fukushima power plant. This has caused them to nearly quadruple in size, and become hyper aggressive.\nAs if that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t horrific enough, the giant hornet also possesses venom which is nearly 2000 times stronger than that of the common wasp. We spoke to doctor Leon Hobbes of the Nebraska Medical Research Symposium and he reported the following:\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen anything like it \xe2\x80\xa6 One sting causes nearly immediate necrosis of surrounding tissue. The venom then quickly spreads causing the destruction of organs. Most victims succumb to renal failure often within hours. Some have had such intense allergic reactions that the complications were enough to cause death within a matter of minutes \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d, The Asian Giant Hornet is the largest species of Hornet in the world with some queens reaching more than 5cm in length. They are found throughout Eastern Asia, particularly in Japan where they are commonlyknown as the Giant Sparrow Bee.\nThis Wasp species is larger than any other with average Asian Giant Hornets growing to between 2.7cm and 4.5cm in length, with a wingspan of around 7cm. The queens can grow to 5.5cm but are similar in appearance to the worker Hornets with an orange head, black mandibles and a black and golden body. The Asian Giant Hornet has two sets of eyes, one compound and one ocelli, both of which are brown in colour along with their legs. Unlike other species of Wasp, and indeed Bees, the stinger of the Asian Giant Hornet is not barbed and therefore remains attached to its body once used. This means that Asian Giant Hornets are able to sting their victims repeatedly, injecting a complex venom that is known to contain eight different chemicals., Hornets have killed dozens of people in China and injured more than 1,500 with their powerful venomous sting.The Asian giant hornet, known scientifically as Vespa mandarinia, carries a venom that destroys red blood cells, which can result in kidney failure and death, said Justin O. Schmidt, an entomologist at the Southwest Biological Institute in Tucson, Arizona.\nBut perhaps a bigger problem than the toxicity of the venom is allergy, Schmidt says. Some people are naturally more allergic to stinging insects than others; a sting can trigger a deadly anaphylactic reaction, which may involve airway closure or cardiac arrest.\nSince July, hornet attacks have killed 42 people and injured 1,675 people in three cities in Shaanxi province, according to the local government. Among those attacked, 206 are receiving treatment in hospitals., National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways.
